# Start Hack 2021

This web application is presented at StartHack2021 on March 20, 2021. This was a 36-hour hackathon. 

In this application, we try to tackle one of the main concerns of international students; How to understand a medical document that is not written in English!.

The main target of this application is to translate medical text and provide a reasonable summary of a said medical document.  Microsoft API was used in this application to identify text and translate them. Original case problem can be found in https://github.com/START-Global/Microsoft-STARTHACK21
